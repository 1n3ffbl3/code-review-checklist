R# code-review-checklist

## Evan's contribution

### Why
* To share knowledge & perspective. This will increase team spirit and help cover for each other in emergencies
* To reach concensus, promoting _conceptual integrity_ in the project
* To prevent avoidable errors by promoting a culture of being wrong
* To always be improving
* To provide welcome breaks in isolated workflow


### How
* Every team, project, and individual are unique. Be sure to revise code review mission and protocol at the start of each new project
* Set up an automated/conventional code-review workflow so it doens't interefere with normal productivity
* Keep your code reviews short and focused.  
  * Developers do this for reviewers when they send a request
  * Reviewers protect their time when they accept a review request
