# Code Review Checklist

## Developer

### Before Request

* Define and document acceptance criteria

 * Acceptance crteria is a thorough description the end state functionality the code is supposed to perform (e.g. for a code intended to work as a calculator acceptance criteria would be:
 - perform SUM correctly  
 - perform multiplication correctly  
 - etc etc)

* Specify (make a list) potential struggles

 * By potential struggles we mean areas in the code which were more challenging to develop and therefore may contain potential errors. Or pieces of the code which contain an implemented solution which you are not sure is the best possible one(simplest, most performant etc).
 * Indicate where in the code the struggle is located (mark it with a specific comment?)
 * If possible indicate the type of struggle (e.g. "check for syntax errors", "check for performance", "check for functionality" etc etc)

### After Request

* Keep an open mind and consider the feedback as an opportunity to learn.
* Review all feedback (or at least try to).
* Reply to your reviewer (even if it's just to thank them for the review)
* Take notes (even if just mental) of new solutions and things you've learned from the review.

## Reviewer

### During Request

* Take your time to review. Be patient
* Review acceptance criteria and verify if it contains all functionality the project/code is supposed to perform.
* Try to understand fully the code before commenting.
* Review carefully all "potential struggles" pieces and reply with a specific commentary. Be as specific as you can demonstrating you have examined the code thoroughly and why you like/dislike the solution.
* Always add references to the related piece in the code when offering a comment.
* Run the code and verify if it meets the specified acceptance criteria.

### After Request

* Keep the conversation going if/when new information or differences of opinion emerge.
* Keep an open mind and consider the feedback as an opportunity to learn.
* Review all feedback (or at least try to).
* Take notes (even if just mental) of new solutions and things you've learned from the review.
